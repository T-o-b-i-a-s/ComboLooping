# ComboLooping
Dcoumentation project for looping with an Accu Chek Spirit Combo

After playing around with https://github.com/monkey-r/ruffy and tools from https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor as well as https://github.com/MilosKozak/AndroidAPS, I decided to support all of these activities by writing a setup-guide to help other people getting started.

Everybody is welcome to contribute to the documentation andimprove it by modifying or updating it.
